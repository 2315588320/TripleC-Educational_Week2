## Intro

Git is a version control tool that helps developers to manage their code such as store contents, maintaining history etc to speed up development speed and efficiency. The general git workflow is illustrated in the diagram below

## Set up

Install git [here](https://git-scm.com/)

After installing, type the following command into the terminal
 ```
git --version
 ```
 It should return the git version if installed successfully 
 

## Repo

Repositories (Repo for short) is an important concept when working with Git, it is basically a container for your project and it's tracked by Git. There are two different types of Repo

- **Local repository:** A repository that is stored in your local computer, your code will be stored in local repository first and then later pushed to the remote repository
- **Remote repository:** A repository stored on the remote server, or you can take it as the "centeralized" code base that allow you to elaborate with other developers

## Code management

### Set up
 
As a little demo, first we make the folder
 ```
mkdir demo
 ```
 And then use the following commnad
 ```
git init
 ```
 That adds a local Git repository to the project (a hidden ```.git``` file will be added to the project). Meanwhile, create a repository on GitHub and it will gives you an link such as ```https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git```
 
 Then you need connect the local and remote repository by doing
 ```
 git remote add origin https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
 ```
 
 Now you are good to go
 
 Or there is an easier way if you think it's too complicated is simply check the ```Add a README file``` when you are creating the repository and then use
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>.git
 ```
 to download the repo to your local machine
 
 ### Get started
 
 Next, we create a txt file inside the ```demo``` folder and type the following command
 ```
 git status
 ```
 This is a command shows us which files have been changed or tracked, etc. If it is executed successfully, you will see
 ```
 On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        example.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
 ```
 
 ### Staging
  Next, we will learn how to push the code from local repo back to the remote repo. To stage the file, the command is
  ```
git add file1 file2 file3
  ```
  where ```file1```, ```file2```, ```file3``` will be the file you edited, but you can also do
  ```
  git add .
  ```
  to automatically stage all the edited file
  
 ### Commit
 
 After staging the file, a commit is used as a checkpoint for your current status. To do this, type the following command
 ```
 git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
 ```
 If it is executed successfully, you will see the following messages:
 ```
 [master (root-commit) 7a3c62c] commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 example.txt
 ```
And now if you type ```git status``` you will see:
```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
[OPTIONAL ]To see all the previous commits, you can use
```
git log
```
to check the detail for your commit messages. For example in this demo, it will be
```
commit 7a3c62cf2ba9a9152f4d6cf359c2247157774af2 (HEAD -> master)
Author: GITHUB_USERNAME <s0000000@email.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 17 21:54:41 2022 -0700

    commit
```

If you want to go back to the previous commit, you can do
```
git checkout <commit-hash>
```
If you want to go to the most recent commit, do
```
git checkout master
```

### Pushing

Finally you can type
```
git push --set-upstream origin master
```
or ```git push``` for short to push your code back into the remote repo and then you are done with this demo! 

The last section is some other important features in git that is highly recommanded to know

## Branches
Branch is an individual timeline of the project commits and it is needed to support multiple parallel developments. It can be illustrated by the diagram below
![](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/gitresources/git-branches-merge.png)

By default, git has ```main``` branch (or ```master``` in older version), to create a new branch, do
```
git branch demo
```
which creates the ```demo``` branch. Then if you want to switch to ```demo``` branch, you can use
```
git checkout demo
```
So now you are on ```demo``` branch, everything you did will be stored in the  ```demo``` branch, and if you want to merge your changed in ```demo``` branch back to the ```main``` branch, you can do
```
git checkout main
git merge <branch-name>
```
So ```git checkout main``` is to go back to the default branch, and ```git merge <branch-name>``` is to merge the changes from ```<branch-name>``` branch to the ```main``` branch


## Others
Lastly, here are some other userful command for future references:
To see all existing branch, (the * branch is the branch that you are currently on)
```
git branch
```
To delete certain branch
```
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

To fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
```
git pull
```
